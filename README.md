# NestJS

Overview
This project is a backend microservices-based application built using NestJS, with a focus on modularity and efficient communication between services.  Each microservice is deployed independently, communicating via TCP protocol and Kafka for real-time and asynchronous interactions, respectively.

Project Objectives
Learn NestJS: The project serves as hands-on practice with NestJS to understand its core concepts and structure.
Implement Microservices: Aimed at understanding microservice principles by dividing functionalities into isolated services.
Practice MongoDB Integration: Basic usage of MongoDB for storing and retrieving data.
Explore Kafka and TCP Communication: Basic use of Kafka for message-based communication and TCP for synchronous calls.

Key Features
Microservices Architecture: Each service is independently deployable and scalable, allowing easy maintenance and enhancement.
NestJS Framework: Each microservice is built on NestJS, ensuring a well-structured, maintainable backend.
MongoDB Integration: MongoDB provides flexible schema support for managing various data needs across services.
Kafka Integration: Kafka enables asynchronous message passing between microservices, allowing them to operate independently and improve system resilience.
TCP Protocol Communication: TCP is used for real-time, synchronous communication where required between services.
Payment Service: A dedicated microservice is available for handling payment transactions securely.
Technologies Used
NestJS: Backend framework for microservices.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for persistent data storage.
Kafka: Message broker for asynchronous communication.
TCP Protocol: For synchronous service-to-service communication.


Communication Between Services
TCP Protocol: Used for synchronous, real-time communication where low-latency data exchange is needed.
Kafka: Used for asynchronous communication, enabling event-driven interactions between services.

Notes
Learning Focus: This project is a practice implementation, so each microservice has basic functionality with minimal complexity.
Room for Improvement: Future enhancements could include adding validations, authentication, error handling, and expanding service functionality.

Conclusion
This project serves as an introductory exploration of NestJS and microservices, integrating MongoDB, Kafka, and TCP communication for a hands-on learning experience. This project provides foundational knowledge in building scalable, modular backend architectures with NestJS. Itâ€™s a practical starting point for expanding into more complex microservice applications.
